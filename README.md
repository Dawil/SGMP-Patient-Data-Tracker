SGMP-Patient-Data-Tracker
=========================

Personal project to help track who/where patient data has gone to.

Development
-----------

In order to get a working development environment you'll need to:

1. Install [`vagrant`](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
2. Clone the repo, `cd` in and run `vagrant up`. The first time will take a while as it downloads all the packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/Dawil/SGMP-Patient-Data-Tracker.git
cd SGMP-Patient-Data-Tracker && vagrant up
```

You can now ssh into the machine with `vagrant ssh`.
